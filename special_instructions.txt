We are trying to fix issues where SSE was not working and ?Book Now? failed to store data. The updated code includes a functional resource controller, correct parameter binding, a valid SSE loop, and a Blade template with Alpine.js that sends JSON to the server. After pressing ?Book Now,? the page remains loaded, data is stored, and the new appointment appears in real time in the appointments list.
